# mongooseCheerio



##Server and API is built with Node.js using the Express Framework.   

##The Node npm Cheerio Library scrapes the front-page of the "javascript" subreddit on Reddit.com. 
## The scraped results are stored in a Mongo Database using Mongoose as an ORM.
##Users are able to save selected articles to a separate section of the website.  From that section, users can add comments to the saved articles, delete those comments or delete the saved articles.


##Front-end is rendered primarily via Handlebars. Layout via Bootstrap Framework. jQuery was utilized in order to dyamically populate the Notes associated with each Article within a Boostrap Modal.
